* Introduction

  An XML parser written in Common Lisp.

  Closure XML was written by Gilbert Baumann (unk6 at
  rz.uni-karlsruhe.de) as part of the Closure web browser.

  Contributions to the parser by
  * Henrik Motakef (hmot at henrik-motakef.de)
  * David Lichteblau (david@lichteblau.com)

  CXML implements a namespace-aware, validating XML 1.0 parser
  as well as the DOM Level 2 Core interfaces. Two parser interfaces
  are offered, one SAX-like, the other similar to StAX.

  CXML is licensed under Lisp-LGPL.

* Documentation

  Please refer to http://common-lisp.net/project/cxml/ for details.

  The documentation is also available in the doc/ subdirectory of this
  source distribution, run =make= in that directory to build HTML
  for the XML sources (requires =xsltproc=).
